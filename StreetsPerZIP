/*
Number of Streets Per Zip Code
Find the number of different street names for each postal code, for the given business dataset. For simplicity, just count the first part of the name if the street name has multiple words. 

For example, East Broadway can be counted as East. East Main and East Broadly may be counted both as East, which is fine for this question. 

Counting street names should also be case insensitive, meaning FOLSOM should be counted the same as Folsom. Lastly, consider that some street names have different structures. For example, Pier 39 is not the same as 39 Pier, and E Broadway is not the same as East Broadway, so your solution should count both situations correctly.
