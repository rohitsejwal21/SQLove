/*
Marketing Campaign Success [Advanced]
You have a table of in-app purchases by user. Users that make their first in-app purchase are placed in a marketing campaign where they see call-to-actions for more in-app purchases. Find the number of users that made additional in-app purchases due to the success of the marketing campaign.

The marketing campaign doesn't start until one day after the initial in-app purchase so users that make multiple purchases on the same day do not count, nor do we count users that make only the same purchases over time.
