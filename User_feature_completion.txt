/*
User Feature Completion
An app has product features that help guide users through a marketing funnel. Each feature has "steps" (i.e., actions users can take) as a guide to complete the funnel. What is the average percentage of completion for each feature?

CODE:

SELECT
    f.feature_id,
    SUM(step_reached)/SUM(n_steps) * 100 AS percentage_completion
FROM facebook_product_features f
LEFT JOIN facebook_product_features_realizations r ON
    r.feature_id = f.feature_id
GROUP BY f.feature_id
