/*
Avg Earnings per Weekday and Hour
Write a query that returns the average earnings per hour by day of the week. For calculating the time period use 'Customer placed order datetime' field. Earnings value is 'Order total' field.
Note: Our questions mimic real-life scenarios, where you would be working with different timezones, hence any day_of_week function works, but for the sake of having your answer accepted, consider the day_of_week function that marks Monday as 1 and Sunday as 7
