/*
Bookings vs Non-Bookings
Display the average number of times a user performed a search which led to a successful booking and the average number of times a user performed a search but did not lead to a booking. 
The output should have a column named action with values 'does not book' and 'books' as well as a 2nd column named average_searches with the average number of searches per action. 
Consider that the booking did not happen if the booking date is null.
