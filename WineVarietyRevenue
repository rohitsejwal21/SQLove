/*
Wine Variety Revenues
Find the total revenue made by each region from each variety of wine in that region. 
Output the region, variety, and total revenue.
Take into calculation both region_1 and region_2 but be careful for cases where region_1 == region_2. 
The revenue shouldn't be counted twice for cases like this.
