/*
Highest Priced Wine In The US
Find the highest price of each variety produced in English speaking regions, but not in Spanish speaking regions, and considering varieties that have earned a minimum of 90 points for every country. 
Use the result to find the highest price of each variety in the US.
Output the variety and the corresponding highest price.
Let's assume the US is the only English speaking region in the dataset, and Spain, Argentina are the only Spanish speaking regions in the dataset. Let's also assume that the same variety might be listed under several countries so you'll need to remove varieties that show up in both the US and in Spanish speaking countries.
