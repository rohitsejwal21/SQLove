Total Sales In Different Currencies
You work for a multinational company that wants to calculate total sales across all their countries they do business in.
You have 2 tables, one is a record of sales for all countries and currencies the company deals with, and the other holds currency exchange rate information.
Calculate the total sales, per quarter, for the first 2 quarters in 2020, and report the sales in USD currency.

SELECT
    DATE_PART('quarter', er.date) AS quarter,
    SUM(sales_amount * exchange_rate) AS total_sales
FROM sf_exchange_rate er
JOIN sf_sales_amount sa ON
    sa.sales_date = er.date AND
    sa.currency = er.source_currency
WHERE TO_CHAR(er.date, 'YYYY-MM') BETWEEN '2020-01' AND '2020-06'
