/*
Most Active Users On Messenger
Meta/Facebook Messenger stores the number of messages between users in a table named 'fb_messages'. In this table 'user1' is the sender, 'user2' is the receiver, and 'msg_count' is the number of messages exchanged between them.
Find the top 10 most active users on Meta/Facebook Messenger by counting their total number of messages sent and received. Your solution should output usernames and the count of the total messages they sent or received
