/*
Update Call Duration
Redfin helps clients to find agents. Each client will have a unique request_id and each request_id has several calls. For each request_id, the first call is an “initial call” and all the following calls are “update calls”.  What's the average call duration for all update calls?

CODE:

SELECT
    AVG(call_duration) AS avg_call_duration
FROM redfin_call_tracking
WHERE created_on NOT IN 
    ( 
    SELECT
        MIN(created_on) 
    FROM redfin_call_tracking 
    GROUP BY request_id 
    )
