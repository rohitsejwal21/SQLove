/*
Ranking Hosts By Beds
Rank each host based on the number of beds they have listed. The host with the most beds should be ranked 1 and the host with the least number of beds should be ranked last. Hosts that have the same number of beds should have the same rank. A host can also own multiple properties. 
Output the host ID, number of beds, and rank from highest rank to lowest.
