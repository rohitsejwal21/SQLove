/*
Rush Hour Calls
Redfin helps clients to find agents. Each client will have a unique request_id and each request_id has several calls. 
For each request_id, the first call is an “initial call” and all the following calls are “update calls”.  
How many customers have called 3 or more times between 3 PM and 6 PM?
