Find the number of inspections for each risk category by inspection type
Find the number of inspections that resulted in each risk category per each inspection type.
Consider the records with no risk category value belongs to a separate category.
Output the result along with the corresponding inspection type and the corresponding total number of inspections per that type. The output should be pivoted, meaning that each risk category + total number should be a separate column.
Order the result based on the number of inspections per inspection type in descending order.
