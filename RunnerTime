/*
Time from 10th Runner
In a marathon, gun time is counted from the moment of the formal start of the race while net time is counted from the moment a runner crosses a starting line. 
Both variables are in seconds. 
How much net time separates Chris Doe from the 10th best net time (in ascending order)? 
Avoid gaps in the ranking calculation. 
Output absolute net time difference.
